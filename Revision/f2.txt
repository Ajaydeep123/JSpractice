2. Modularize
This is the most important part: Anyone is capable of creating modules (aka libraries). To quote Isaac Schlueter (of the node.js project): "Write small modules that each do one thing, and assemble them into other modules that do a bigger thing. You can't get into callback hell if you don't go there."
